# Advanced GIS Portfolio (90-753)
#### Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy, Carnegie Mellon University

## About me
My name is Caroline (she/her). I am a second-year graduate student at Heinz College, and will graduate with an M.S. Public Policy & Management in May, 2023. Before coming to Heinz, I earned my B.A. degree from Lafayette College, double-majoring in Music and Anthropology & Sociology. My interests at the intersection of music and sociology allowed me to conduct a senior capstone project analyzing the reactions of independent musicians to digital streaming platforms. I also developed an interest in the structures of American social welfare services and the U.S. criminal legal system through my Lafayette coursework.

These burgeoning policy interests during my undergraduate studies led me to Heinz College, where I have continued to expand my areas of exploration in pursuit of a Master's degree -- both within and outside of the arts landscape. Over the past two years, I have focused primarily on education equity and childcare access, both through my coursework at Heinz College as well as during a summer internship with the Allegheny County Department of Human Services (ACDHS). In addition to these primary interests, I have also forayed into other policy areas, including: environmental emissions, transportation infrastructure, housing and community development.

## What I hope to learn
Advanced GIS is particularly interesting to me because of the regional component of my policy interests. Both education and childcare access are geographically-based phenomena, with substantial inequities arising from localized tax bases (invariably shaped by a national history of residential segregation) and transportation infrastructure. I am hoping to expand my understanding of education and childcare access through this class by using ArcGIS and other spatial analysis tools. I am particularly interested in the potential policy implications of spatial data science, as the analyses enabled by ArcGIS and related tools can expand and update our knowledge of the geographic distribution of opportunity in a way that allows us to influence policy more effectively. 

## Portfolio
The pages of this portfolio represent various assignments I have completed for the course 90-753: Advanced GIS. Click on the following links to explore these assignments in depth:

+ [Build and Deploy a Custom Map](https://c-sabin.github.io/AdvancedGIS_Portfolio/NonProfitWebpage-HW2)
  *In this assignment, I created a color palette to represent the non-profit organization Saga Education. Based on this brand's colors, I built a custom map style using the Google Styling Wizard. I then deployed this using Google's Cloud platform.*
  
+ [Mapping the DEA's Pain Pill Database](https://c-sabin.github.io/AdvancedGIS_Portfolio/PainPillsWV-HW3)
  *This assignment allowed me to explore the capabilities of ArcGIS Insights, a web-based dashboarding tool provided through Esri. I investigated the flow of two schedule two drugs from various pharmacies into Mingo County, West Virginia. I also created a slide deck comparing ArcGIS Insights to the traditional ArcGIS Pro environment, for anyone considering which tool may best suit their project needs.*
