# Advanced GIS Portfolio (90-753)
#### Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy, Carnegie Mellon University

## About me
My name is Caroline (she/her). I am a second-year graduate student at Heinz College, and will graduate with an M.S. Public Policy & Management in May, 2023. Before coming to Heinz, I earned my B.A. degree from Lafayette College, double-majoring in Music and Anthropology & Sociology. My interests at the intersection of music and sociology allowed me to conduct a senior capstone project analyzing the reactions of independent musicians to digital streaming platforms. I also developed an interest in the structures of American social welfare services and the U.S. criminal legal system.

These burgeoning policy interests during my undergraduate studies led me to Heinz College, where I have continued to expand my areas of exploration in pursuit of a Master's degree. Over the past two years, I have focused on education equity and childcare access through both my coursework at Heinz and my summer internship with the Allegheny County Department of Human Services. In addition to these focus areas, I have also forayed into environmental emissions, transportation infrastructure, housing policy, and artistic and cultural community development.

## What I hope to learn
Both education and childcare access are geographically-based phenomena, with substantial inequities due to localized tax bases (fostered by a history of residential segregation) and transportation infrastructure. I am hoping to expand my understanding of education and childcare access through this class by  use of ArcGIS and spatial analysis
