## Homework 3: Mapping the DEA's Pain Pill Data with ArcGIS Insights
Advanced GIS Portfolio (90-753)

### The Data
The United States' Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has a comprehensive database monitoring the nationwide flow of pain pills between manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacies. This database contains the distributor's origin addresses (*REPORTER_ADDRESS*) as well as the destination pharmacy's address (*BUYER_ADDRESS*), which enables analysts to link the distributors to pharmacies for each pain pill sold in the United States. Specifically, the data focuses on oxycodone and hydrocodone pills that travelled across the U.S. between 2006 and 2014. 

Recently, the Washington Post published an article whereby they analyze "nearly 500 million transactions" within this time period. Access to the article and the DEA database can be found here: [Washington Post's analysis of the DEA pain pill database](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/dea-pain-pill-database/).

#### Mingo County, West Virginia
For this assignment, I will be focusing on Mingo County, West Virginia. This focus comes from the unusually high amount of rates of perscriptions delivered to the pharmacies in this county, given the relatively small population of the area. According to the Washington Post's analysis, the immense flow of prescription pills into Mingo County averages out to *each county resident* buying about 180 pills per year. 

To further analyze this flow of pain pills within Mingo County, I used **ArcGIS Insights**. The resulting analysis can be found below:
